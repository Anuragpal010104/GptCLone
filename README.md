# GPT Clone Project

Welcome to the GPT Clone Project! This project aims to create a simplified clone of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model that can generate responses based on user input.

## Overview

The GPT Clone uses advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and generate human-like text responses. It's built on the principles of transformer models, allowing it to capture intricate patterns and context in the input data.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding:** The model can comprehend user input and context to generate meaningful responses.
- **Customizable Responses:** Fine-tune the model for specific domains or use cases to tailor responses as needed.
- **Easy Integration:** The GPT Clone is designed for straightforward integration into various applications and projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the GPT Clone up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpt-clone.git
   cd gpt-clone
